# StudentTimesheet
A simple timesheet for student employees to clock in and out, recording data and time worked.

# Installation
Under the github release section two versions are available. The plain JAR, which needs a Java 8 runtime or above to run. The standalone version, which does not need a Java runtime to run, but comes packaged with one instead.
